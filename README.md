# Telco Customer Churn EDA & High-Risk Segment Analysis

An **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of the Telco Customer Churn dataset to identify key drivers of customer attrition and uncover high-risk segments.

## Key Findings
- **60.4% and 68.1% churn rate** in two critical segments consecutively:
  1. **Fiber optic + Electronic check + Month-to-month**
  2. **High monthly cost (≥$70) + Short tenure (≤12 months)**
- Customers with **short tenure and high charges** are most likely to churn.
- Underutilized services like **Online Security** and **Online Backup** present retention opportunities.

## Business Recommendations
- Offer **discounts upon 1-year tenure completion** to reduce early churn.
- Provide **6-month free trials** for add-on services to increase perceived value and loyalty.

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
- `data.csv` – [Telco Customer Churn (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
